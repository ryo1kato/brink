# brink(1) - Arduino based USB LED notification device

Inspired by [blink(1)](https://blink1.thingm.com/).
Using Arduino's default USB-serial interface to control LEDs, and equiped with command line interpreter based on [picoshell](https://github.com/ryo1kato/picoshell)

This is still an early prototype.
